Putting the social in social distance!

Workout Legends is a mobile app that gamifies workouts, targeted for users who are sheltering in place. Users create their own avatars and increase their avatars' stats by completing different kinds of workouts. Users unlock quests by increasing their stats, and the quests draw from traditional fantasy RPGs as well as the existing quarantine situation.

Workout Legends is built with React Native, GraphQL, and PostgresQL.
